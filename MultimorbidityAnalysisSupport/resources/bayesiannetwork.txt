Using the Bayesian Network view, a user can create, modify and study a Bayesian Network.

Step 1.
You first need to select the columns with are a part of the network. Only factor column which don't contain any unknown values may be selected.

Step 2,
Use the dropdown list to select the algorithm to run. Press the calculate button to 'learn' the network.
The network will appear to the right. If the network is valid, the CPT values with also be calculated. These can be viewed on a different panel.

A network is valid if:
* there are no Cirkels.
* there is a maximum of 1 Arc between two different Nodes. 

Step 3. Optional.
You can score the network, by selecting a scoring algorithm and pressing the calculate button.

Step 4. Optional
Use the dropdown menus to select two different Nodes. Using the three button the Arcs can be manipulated.

The options are:
* Set, a new Arc is created if no Arc exists.
* Drop, the Arc is deleted if one exists.
* Reverse, the Arc is reversed if one exists.
 
Step 5.
With the following buttons results can be saved and loaded:
* Save Network, this option saves a RES file.
* Load Network, this option loads a RES file.
* Export Network, this option exports the network as a R Net file. This file can only be read by R.
