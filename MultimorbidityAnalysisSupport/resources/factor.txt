Factor Analysis is used to conceal hidden variables explaining the behavior of your observed variables. 
The goal is find a smaller number of new variables (latent variables) which explain your whole data well.

step1: select numerical variables that will be used for factor analysis

step2: help me determine the optimal number of factors. A plot will be shown as a result: 
       look for a bend in the plot, the moment it starts to go up.
       
step3: start EFA (Explanatory Factor Analysis) using a method, given the (optimal) 
       number of factors determined in step 2.
       Determine scores given number of factors.        
        
step4: start CFA (Confirmatory Factor Analysis) by selecting first the variables 
       corresponding to the (possible) latent variable concealed in step 3.
