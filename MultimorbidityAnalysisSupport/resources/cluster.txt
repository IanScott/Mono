Cluster Analysis is the the process of grouping variables together in such a way 
that variables in one group are more similar than variables in other groups.

All features, variables based on which clustering will be done, must be numeric 
or have to be converted to numeric prior clustering. Use the edit panel.

step1: Select the categorical clustering variable based on which the generation of clusters is done.

step2: select the numerical variables (features/properties) based on which clusters are determined.

step3: help determine the optimal number of clusters. A plot of the within groups sum of squares 
       will be shown as a result: look for a bend in the plot, the moment it starts to go up.
       
step4: View the summary of some attributes of the clustering process based on 
       the (optimal) number of clusters determined in step 3. 
       repeat this step until it's clear which number will be used for clustering (step 5)
       
step5: Determine clustering using a method, given the number of clusters determined in step 3 and 4.
