Association analysis is the task of finding interesting relationships between variables in a data sets. 

1) Correlation between two numeric variables

- Should missing values be removed? Please use the Edit Panel.

- use/completeness: a method for computing covariances in the presence of missing values. 
    * all.obs (then the presence of missing observations will produce an error)
    * complete.obs (then missing values are handled by casewise deletion)
    * pairwise.complete.obs (computed using all complete pairs of observations on those variables)

- method: a character string indicating which correlation coefficient is to be computed. 
    * pearson 
    * kendall
    * spearman

It also possible to conduct a correlation test given an alternative hypothesis and with a confidential level of 95% as default.
 
2) Odds Ration and relative risk between two categorical variables

Relative Risk, Odds Ratio are measures of the DIRECTION and the STRENGTH of the association between two categorical variables.

- method: a character string indicating the experimental design. 
          Options are cohort.count, cohort.time, case.control, or cross.sectional.

- conf.level: magnitude of the returned confidence intervals. Must be a single number between 0 and 1.
