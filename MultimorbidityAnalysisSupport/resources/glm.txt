Instruction Generalized Linear Model (GLM) Tool

Use this Panel to determine the dependency of a single variable on one or more other variables.

Prerequisites:
The Variables/Columns have to be Factorial (Levels). 
If the variable you want to count is not the required type you can use the Edit Data Menu to convert the variable.

Again, only Varibles/Columns with the Factor type (with 0 to N Levels) can be selected.
Use Edit Data Menu to convert Variables if needed.
