Welcome to the Bachelor Project of ABI team 37.

The aim of our Bachelor Project was to create an application to help researcher study Multimorbidity.

Multimorbidity is the occurrence of more than one (chronic) illness in an individual during a certain period of time. 

Analyzing multimorbidity is a task mainly performed by epidemiologists. To aid them with this important work we have created this application.

The goals of this application are twofold. Firstly, to leverage the power of the R framework. And Secondly to introduce researchers to the possibilities of R and to demonstrate how this framework can contribute greatly to their work.
