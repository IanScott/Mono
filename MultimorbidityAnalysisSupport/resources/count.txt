Instruction CountTool

Use this Panel to count variables.

Prerequisites:
The Variables/Columns have to be Logical (True or False). 
If the variable you want to count is not this type you can use the Edit Data Menu to convert the variable.

Beware: 
The values "TRUE"/"true" and 1 with be converted to TRUE.
The values "FALSE"/"false" and 0 with be converted to FALSE.
Other values with be converted to <NOT A BOOLEAN>, you will have to manually convert this value to TRUE or FALSE.

The panel automatically tries to group the counted values by a Factor if a Factorial Variable is selected.

Again, only Varibles/Columns with the Factor type (with 0 to N Levels) can be selected.
Use Edit Data Menu to convert Variables if needed.
